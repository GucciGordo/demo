This is an exploration into the server side of web development. This tool creates user accounts and stores the data on a php database on a local machine. XAMPP control panel was used to run apache and mysql. Passwords are encrypted using a php password hashing algorithm (bcrypt). 

TODO:
Password recovery. -- CANNOT SEND EMAIL FROM LOCAL SERVER
Account success email.
Email verification.
Phone verification and text.
Use this project to learn a framework.
Add primary key to users table.
Animations do not behave nice with resizing of browser plsfix


SIDE NOTES:
Recreated server on seperate machine. Wonder if hashed password spells out same chars.
Wondered about hosting my own server. bad idea. Learned most hosts provide phpMyAdmin functionality.
