This is an exploration into the server side of web development. This tool creates user accounts and stores the data on a php database on a local machine. XAMPP control panel was used to run apache and mysql. Passwords are encrypted using a php password hashing algorithm. 

TODO:
Password recovery.
More error handling.
Account success email.
Email verification.
Phone verification adnd text.
Make php server a little more portable. Need to be able to switch between devices. Perhaps host on the web.
Recreated server on seperate machine. Wonder if hashed password spells out same chars.
